# Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas Python
-
In this project, I use Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions regarding 3 years sales data of Superstore. The data consists  thousands of store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, to name but a few. 

Dataset: https://github.com/EDSOfficial/Sales-Analysis

## Questions to address:

* Q1: What is the overall Sales trend? 
* Q2: What are the top 10 Products by sales?
* Q3: What are the most selling Products?
* Q4: What is the most preferred Ship Mode?
* Q5: Which are the most profitable Product Category and Sub-Category?
